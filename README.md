# Overview

For this project I wanted to learn how to make a game. In turn the project lead me to learn the Unity game engine, more about C# and how to work with 3d models.

This game is a 3rd person game where you must defeat enemies with your sword and special powers. It uses the keyboard and mouse.
W, A, S, and D will move your character
Q gives you a buff
left-click will do a sword attack
right-click will od a special attack
move the moust to look around

I have wanted to make a game for a while before this project. This is my first attempt at making my own game so that I could fulfill that desire and develop the skills to do so.
